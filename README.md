# 3D Chess

Working repository for USF GameDev club's project for the 53rd annual USF egineering expo. Basically, chess but with a third spatial dimension, with unique piece movements to accomodate the new space. This is a Unity project, and will require an installation of Unity6 to interact with.

## TO DO

### Art/Visuals:

- Better 3D models, and a nicer looking background
- Directional lighting, and other atmospheric elements
- Some kind of change to make the board more readable
- Misc: some kind of UI design/concept so that players can know how to play and what the score is

### Programming:

- Algorithm to detect checkmate/stalemate (a brute force algorithm that checks every possible move would probably be ok :sob:)
- Add special moves (pawn double first move, castling, and en passant)
- Code to track player scores, and update UI (when UI is made lol)
- Set up controls to work with a controller
- Misc. bug fixes
